# Web-Development-Projects
A COMPLETE COMPILATION of all my web development projects ranging everything from websites, portfolios,web APKs, games, effects galleries and much more all condensed into 4 simple folders and over 100 files documented perfectly for proper knowledge sharing.

This repository contains projects for `absolute beginners` such as CSS preloaders or JS to-do-list apps, for `intermediate programmers` such as the expense grapher, beatmaker, mealDB projects, and finally, it also contains projects for `experienced developers` such as MERN stack projects, desktop apps using Electron JS and a few advanced JS OOP projects.

I hope to share my knowledge and experience with as many people as possible.
